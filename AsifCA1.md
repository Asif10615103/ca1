## Cloud Strategy of Hyperion Design & Development Ltd. (HDDL)


### Background of the Enterprise

Hyperion Design & Development Ltd (HDDL) is one of the leading real estate companies in Bangladesh specializing in superior quality residential buildings in the prime location of Dhaka city. It has become a trusted name in the real estate sector in Bangladesh. During the last 13 years, the company has won the confidence and goodwill of its clients. Within a short span of time, Hyperion has grown into a renowned and dependable organization. This company is committed to ensure quality in each project and for that purpose the management gives attention in every aspect of a project. So it has developed an in-house design team for Architectural, structural, plumbing and electrical design. Hyperion has thirty engineers in the construction and development team in addition to its quality control, monitoring & construction management personnel. One of the strongest points of HDDL is its efficient Customer Service Department. This department gives personal attention to each client and is known for prompt & effective action. A warm friendly atmosphere is created for the clients who can make purchase decisions at his/her pace without feeling pressurized.


### Current IT Setup

HDDL has an online presence through its website www.hddlbd.com. Though it doesn't have any in-house IT department, it takes support from a third party company to maintain its website. The employees use a combination of fixed terminals, laptops, tablets and mobile phones to perform tasks. So, basically they store and retrieve their customer data and other important resources in their in-house computers which make it a limited accessible resource pool. It maintains a very fast and reliable internet connection. To communicate with the client, it uses the traditional fixed-line phone system and also the web form. Email communication is also very much into practice for ins and outs communication. In the case of software, the company uses very basic ones. There is no custom software and use of information systems in the company. 

There are currently 70 employees working under this company. They have a marketing, a construction & designing and an accounting department.


### Recommendation

- Now the employees share files through emails when someone needs to access them, which kills the time. Also when there is an update, the file needs to be sent again and confusion arises with multiple files. But the operation can become easy and simple if they have clouds. Employees will have quick access to the data over the cloud. The projects are based on different locations, in that case, employees need to work remotely from different project locations. It will be much easier for them if they can store their data in the cloud so that they can access it from anywhere and anytime. Therefore, having a cloud is very much essential for them at this time.

- The company has an increasing number of customers. At present, they maintain an excel file to keep the customer data. But if they use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software which can be run in a private cloud (Software as a Service - SaaS) they can be benefitted by the rapid reconstitution of their services. This way the data storage can be easy and a large amount of customer data can be saved and retrieved easily from anywhere and anytime using that cloud service.

- Having a cloud based software will help the company manage the projects in a more organized and effective way. All the departments of the company will be linked with one another. The communication inside and outside the company will be easy with the help of the cloud. The company can have a hybrid cloud where they can manage the confidential documents (such as land deed, customer banking details etc.) and customized softwares in private cloud and other storages can be done in public cloud.


### Conclusion

Though HDDL has an online presence as mentioned above, that is only used as a promotion of their company to the outsiders but there is no cloud platform for their business which can be used regularly by their employees. As they are now dealing with more clients and many employees from different departments have to work together in a particular project to make it a successful one, I think there is no alternative for them other than having a hybrid cloud system.
